            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              At Pine Tools Hub ("we," "our," or "us"), we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our website pinetoolshub.com (the "Site") and use our PDF and image processing tools.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the site.
            </p>

            <h2>Our Privacy-First Approach</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Pine Tools Hub is built with privacy at its core.</strong> Unlike many online document tools, our tools process your files entirely within your web browser. This means:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Your files are never uploaded to our servers</strong></li>
              <li><strong>We cannot see, access, or store the content of your documents</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Your files remain on your device throughout the entire process</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Once you close or refresh the page, no trace of your files remains</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This browser-based processing approach ensures the highest level of privacy for your sensitive documents.
            </p>
